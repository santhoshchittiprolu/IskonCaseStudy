The God almighty Shri Krishna is on the top of a small hillock in Malleswaram area in Bangalore. From the main road, you can either drive down or walk up. To enjoy the scenario, I recommend walking up. In the steps up, you can have the darshan of Lord.Ganesha, Lord Narasimha , Lord Hanuman and Lord Balaji. Once you enter the main Lord Krishna hall, you really feel the vibe rations, your concentration increases and you are into different world. In spite of the big crowed the place is kept very clean.

Two ways to enter in main sabhagruha: (1) By following usual queue (2) By paying extra fees- VIP entry Apart from this, one can buy different items such as pooja items, photos, frames, key-chains, t-shirts, kurtas, idols etc. of lord Krishna from here. Also, some sweets and food items available. Interesting thing is to speak 103/108 times mantra of lord Krishna. In short, it's worth to see at least once. Worth to see on Non-Festive day with Family"

With Hare Krishna chants going on continuously, it really feels good..Also, no garlands or coconut can be offered so the temple is really clean... You can sit and keep watching the idols for hours and you will really feel at peace... The best part is the khichadi that they server as prasad... its always piping hot and really tasty.. They give in a leaf bowl and not too much quantity so you dont tend to waste it... Nice temple to go and visit.. Really worth visiting it once?"

The temple is impressive, but the guys selling the books next to the are where the prayers are done disturb the procedure from my point of view. It is good to know that the money spent is used for the poor to provide poor kids with meals, but at the same time quite some amount is also used to built further impressive temples. If at the end this helps the poor it is fine. The gold statues inside are really impressive. If you go there as a foreigner, note that cameras inside are not allowed (once I was allowed to take it with me, once I had to leave it with the driver - so you need to have trust in your Rikshaw driver). Same applies for shoes, you either leave it outside of the temple or with the driver as inside people are only allowed to walk with bare foot. The temple even provides some free meal. Be cautious as it can be quite spicy. I usually buy some souvenirs or scents at the temple, things are reasonably priced, so there you do not get cheated and you can make a bargain on some items while supporting the temple and the poor. I would anybody also recommend to visit the Shiv Mandir temple next to the Leela Hotel on Old Airport Road. It provides a nicer spiritual experience. The Bull temple is nice as well (but much smaller and it does by far not provide the same spiritual experience as the Shiva Mandir or the ISKON) and somehow the guys there always try to rip me off.

Inside the Temple: Most of the time, there will be a long queue (minimum length of 0.5 Km), until we reach the shrine. The same Queue shall be followed to come out of the temple. The queue to the exit is totally commercialized, making the disciples and visitors walk a longer way until they come out of the temple. All this far, we have options to buy Goodies, sweets, Ayurvedic stuffs, and other souvenirs. The disciples and priests are well behaved and down to earth people, which is one point to be noted. Note: - Mobile phones with Camera and Cameras are not allowed inside the temple. There is also Frisking as in airport where we need to even declare these items.

Also make sure you are dressed appropriately although there is the option of renting items of clothing when you get there. When we got there we were told what the entry fee was and we were sold a ticket that looks like it was a ticket that allowed us to fast track through the temple (avoiding the queues). Whilst we were not intentionally looking for such a ticket it worked for us given it was raining. The main hall was very impressive with the gold ornaments and the gold ornaments were beautiful. ?Very large modern temple?,3,POSITIVE,Very impressive temple and attracts large crowds which does means large queues.

I am not a religious person at all and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying and we had a whole day with nothing else to do and so we decided to give this place a try. And I'm glad that I did. After a few minutes in this place something started bothering me, something that was not quite what you would expect in a temple and I couldn't put my finger on it. And then it hit me! This place is CLEAN! And no SMELL!! No beggars at the entrance!!! The cleanliness is something that you do not associate with temples usually. There, I have said it. Sad, but true. Let us face the truth....temples are not very clean because you usually see rotting fruits, coconuts and flowers being thrown around and temples usually have a peculiar but unique smell (like our railway stations. You can smell a railway station before you reach it). ISKCON is squeaky clean and only has a pleasant smell. That is a big plus in my book. There is a constant, repetitive, droning chant going on over the discreetly placed public address system. You can not escape it. It follows you everywhere like Mary's little lamb. If you like such things, you'll find it quite peaceful and divine. For me it got old in a hurry and started driving me a little crazy after an hour or so. Well, that's just my opinion. You may find the droning voice quite soothing. They have a big area selling some nice posters, statuettes, lovely T shirts and other trinkets. There is a big walk-around restaurant where they sell very good, tasty meal for a very reasonable price. This place was not that clean but I think you should blame it on the people who visit and not the management. Even though there are many dustbins some people were dumping their plates where they stood and not in the bins. But I think we will learn to keep our public places clean very soon. Like in a million years. I mean, what is the big hurry? As you leave, they give you prasadam which is quite tasty. They give it in a disposable cup and again our people just eat and dump those cups all over the place except in the dustbins. Only these two areas are not so clean (even though the employees/volunteers keep picking up the discarded food plates). Give this place a try.

The family consists of strong believers, not so 'strong' ones, moderately devout and pure touristas! ( as all families consist!) But all of us enjoyed the outing . There are elaborate arrangements for storage of your footwear and an ingenious system for washing the feet of the devotees as you walk in... The architectural marvel is right in the heart of the city. For the devout, there is definitely the ""presence"" the ambiance of the Supreme Being, amidst all the hustle and bustle of the crowd and the some-what un-subtle commercialization. If you are going because you are a firm devotee, please select a less crowded time like early mornings or afternoons, certainly not evenings in the week end.. There is a separate circuit for the believers, where you move from step to step chanting the prayer, which is moving and thought provoking, if you have the time. Don't get into that loop if you are there for a quick dekko and exit. There is a VIP darshan, which is not fair to the regular devotees, but alas, a fact of life.

No cameras are allowed to be used but you can use your mobile to take photos. Footwear must be removed before entering the temple area. There are quite a number of steps to climb before reaching the main worshipping area. The temple is very clean and neat. It appears to be a fairly new temple compared to others I visited and according to my guide, is supported by donations worldwide. I have to say that although it was a large complex I wasn't impressed either by the inside or the out. I was left with the impression that it was more of a business venture rather than a spiritual one; but still worth a visit even just for the photo opportunity.

2849,2389,Trip Advisor,Fred S,26-03-2016,Religie ontmoet commercie,"Van de tempels die ik bezocht heb was dit verreweg de grootste. Ik was er op goede vrijdag, een vrije dag in India en de belangstelling was overweldigend. Met zijn vieren konden we voor 1000 roepies een VIP pas kopen. Daarmee heb je met maximaal 6 personen toegang tot de hele tempel en word je om de rijen heen geleid. En rijen waren er. Na twee kleinere tempels kom je terecht in wat ik de hoofdtempel zou noemen. Wie in de rij gestaan heeft is nu eindelijk bij zijn doel aangekomen. Wij werden verwezen naar een wachtruimte en verzocht te gaan zitten. Uiteindelijk stonden we vlak voor het altaar. Priesters voerden daar een ritueel op en daarna kregen we een bloem voor achter het oor. Ondanks dat ik weinig van de religie weet een indrukwekkende ervaring. Minder vond ik wat daarna kwam. Niet de uitleg van wat Hare Krishna nu inhoudt, maar wel de enorme hoeveelheid stands met Merchandise. Menig professionele voetbalclub zou er wat van kunnen leren. Zelf ben ik nog opgevoed met het beeld van Jezus die de handelaren de tempel uit sloeg... De opbrengst schijnt wel naar een goed doel te gaan. Maar de ""gemiddeld"" is er een uitvloeisel van. Al met al toch wel een spirituele ervaring. Wel was ik blij met het advies van onze chauffeur om de schoenen vast in de auto te laten. Voor mijn gevoel scheelde dat een hoop gedoe na afloop. Religie ontmoet commercie",3,POSITIVE,"Of the temples I visited, this was by far the largest. I was there on Good Friday, a day off in India, and the interest was overwhelming. The four of us could buy a VIP pass for 1000 rupees. This gives you access to the entire temple with a maximum of 6 people and you are guided around the rows. And there were lines. After two smaller temples you end up in what I would call the main temple. Whoever stood in line has now finally arrived at his destination. We were directed to a waiting area and asked to sit down. Finally we were right in front of the altar. Priests performed a ritual there and then we got a flower behind the ear. Despite the fact that I know little about the religion, an impressive experience. I liked less what came next. Not the explanation of what Hare Krishna means now, but the enormous amount of stands with Merchandise. Many professional football clubs could learn something from it. I myself was raised with the image of Jesus who beat the traders out of the temple... The proceeds seem to go to a good cause. But the ""average"" is a corollary to it. All in all, a spiritual experience. I was happy with our driver's advice to leave the shoes in the car. I feel like that saved a lot of hassle afterwards. Religion meets commerce"

The atmosphere is little-bit crowded but pleasure to visit. In the early morning, the atmosphere is quite different and really gives a different feeling. I like and love the place. There is a guest house facility for the family who wishes to stay by paying a small donation. But those who are Life Members, may stay up to three nights in free of cost.

One can buy the Bhagawad Gita by Swami Prabhupada translated into various regional languages. There is very tight security. The place is very cleanly maintained. Cameras are not allowed - but there are cloak rooms to leave your camera and collect them on the way out. A large number of steps need to be taken to reach the sanctum sanctorum - elderly people could find it difficult - but I think there are special darshan passes to avoid the steps (not sure - saw some signages about special darshan at extra cost).

If you have limited time in Bangalore than better not to prioritize it. As it is, Bangalore traffic takes up a lot of travel time and then the temple security and formality have to be complied with. Even when not crowded, the compulsion to repeat the mantra at every step before entering the darshan hall creates slow moving queues without adding any spiritual value. (Can any enforced experience ever be spiritual ? ) After all this ,the architecture and art aren't extraordinary. The main darshan hall does have lovely golden decor and beautifully painted ceiling but then so do most big temples, along with better gardens, carving, history and less hassle. The exit is a long ,winding route through a "" big bazaar"" of religious items , books and a huge ( and yummy ) variety of food counters.

This is a Krishna temple, on a small hillock, which is one of the star attractions in Bangalore. The decorations around the main deity is amazing and you can sit down for some time leisurely. This is not like any other typical temple, where we can offer flowers and perform 'Abhishek'.

The devotees at ISKON run the temple on a volunteer basis and very often people who have been in important positions and jobs have given up their material life to devote themselves to be volunteers in this organization. Their free food Scheme called Akshayapatra delivers thousands of meals to needy children across different parts of Bangalore all managed by the devotees making it one of the biggest such endeavors in the world as it is run for 365 days a year without any break.

Well it's situated near to Orion Mall and Sheraton hotel. The well organised structure starts right when you enter it. From footwear counter to main temple complex all are well organised. First one gets to entrance with 108 petals where one is required to chant a mantra to reach entrance of temple. Alternate direct route is there from left too. First idol is of Narsingh God. After this is another idol and then you enter the main complex. The paintings on terrace and the chandelier is absolutely beautiful. The main idol of Krishna God is placed here. On exiting you'll be routed through their magazine section. While climbing down is a small tuckshop where one can buy sweets. Below this floor is beautiful carvings for different stages of human. Then again some shops. In next floor again some food stuff and shopping. In next floor again food stuff this time sweets like jalebi too. Then you'll see restaurant. Then there's exit.

You have to climb a lot of stairs to reach the main temple as well as pass through a couple of other smaller temples. The location of the temple is perfect. It is bang opposite the Sandal Soap factory and has become a landmark in itself. Close-by, you have the Orion Mall as well as the Sheraton Hotel. You have to pass through two security checks before you start the ascent to the temple. One at the entrance and the other after you deposit your bags and shoes. The entire system is very organized with volunteers and sevaks guiding you till you reach the top. The inner sanctum reverberates with the auspicious chants of ""Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare"". Listening to this chant, makes you feel at peace with yourself. After taking darshan of the Lord, you have to pass through a long route which is lined with the activities of the ISKCON group viz Books, Akshay Patra details etc. They also have a mini-theater which was showing animated films with respect to Lord Krishna. After darshan, you get prasadam which is generally a rice-based hot khicdi. Keep in mind that you will be allowed entry only if you are dressed in proper clothing. No shorts/three-fourths allowed for gents. Overall, you may spend approximately one hour in the temple premises with delays only during peak times like evening aartis.

Entrance to the temple is free but they also have a ""special entry pass"" for 300INR. Not sure if that was only because it was Independence Day (August 15) or if they always have that. Anyway, what's good about the pass, especially if you're a tourist in a hurry, is you get to bypass the queue of devotees. When we were there, it was full house so the special entry pass gave us our space and we got to walk according to our pace. I hope that made sense.

It has a top quality management, which manages the temple on professional lines. On normal days you will find crowds entering through the main gates will be able to drive through almost till the main entrance to the temple. The temple is located over a hilly-land area of aprox 7-8 Acres, this was just another hill which was transformed into this amazing temple by the efforts of the temple committee. It incorporates a wonderful synthesis and fusion of traditional temple architecture with modern principles of construction and civil engineering. When you access the temple premises by foot, you will initially reach a footwear leaving place where you can deposit your footwear and walk further up to the actual temple environs. You will notice that most of the pathway is protected against rain and hot sun for those special days. You will soon be at the very entrance to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple where you will be faced with two options of going through the 108 rounded steps wherein you can enjoy the charm of reciting the Hare Krishna mahamantra on each step while waiting for the Queue to move forward, and this will be an enjoyable experience which is relished by many. Alternately, you can also by-pass this and use the other direct route, if you are short of time, wherein you can go to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple by the side route. When you enter the Sh. Laxmi Narasimha Swamy temple you will be struck by the awesome beauty and the amazing sculpture work of the main deity over here, you will want to stare at it to eternity and will be lost in spiritual ecstasy, however, life must move on and the crowds behind you would also want to have a glimpse of the Lord, and so they will usher you to the next temple. Do remember to pay your obeisance/worship to the Deities of Garudadeva and Shri. Hanuman on either side at the entrance of the Narasimha shrine. You will now be at the entrance of the Shri Srinivasa Govinda Temple where you will once again be mesmerized by the outstanding fineness and excellence of the sculpture work and you will feel as if you have been magically and suddenly tranlocated to Tirupati. After you enjoy the reverberations of Govinda, Govinda, you will now head to the main temple. The vast main hall on level 3 is accessed by wide steps with banisters and has a beautiful gold plated altar, with attractive interior designs and a ceiling with huge paintings, which are held together from the roof down, depicting the pastimes of Lord Krishna with His devotees. There is an all round internal balcony which gives a view of the temple sanctum sanctorum and this adds to the glamour and beauty of this place and also gives a birds eye view for the people during festivities when the crowds are spilling into the streets a kilometer or two long on occassions like Janmashtami etc. Everyday thousands of devotees from various parts of India and other countries visit the temple to seek the blessings of Their Lordships. At the main temple you will be bewitched by extraordinary beauty of The Presiding Deities in the temple Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga (Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). After having prayed to their lordships to your hearts content, remember to offer your respects to the most beautiful bronze sculpture of Srila Prabhupada who is peacefully witness to all the goings on in the temple and who guides the same by his divine presence. You will also see the endless rows of books by Srila and other devotees which are available for sale. If possible one should take this opportunity to contribute towards a life membership of ISKCON which will also feed millions of children in schools through the Akshaya Patre (endless supply of food, originally given by Lord Surya the Sun God to Yudhishtira, the Pandava King) program. While you allow all these things to soak into your mind and body, get back to Planet Earth and head towards the exit you will find lots of shops and sales points where every type of devotional stuff and vegetable eatery is available to satiate your taste buds, do check them out if you are in a hurry to move to the next location on your itinerary, otherwise head straight to the Higher Taste Restaurant in the same premises to eat like the Kings & his courtiers, see review separately for The Higher Taste Restaurant.

This time when I visit Bengaluru, Bengaluru has several gems in its crown and ISKCON temple indeed deserves a central attention place. It's an admirably treat for eyes for devotees and tourists alike. Beautifully crafted architecture and design, craftsmanship, Grand Idols of RadhaKrishna & ors. Maybe you have seen lots of other ISKCON temples in other parts of India and probably all appear same. Even then if you are in Bengaluru, don't miss ISKCON. Give it one hour minimum, if you can. Krishna is going to be a nice experience and feel. Please Don't opt for special Darshanam. Move as a common simple man and enjoy Krishna's Consciousness in everyone you see, then, may be for a split second, you may feel it is Krishna Consciousness in you too. In case you want to offer any puja etc then you may buy the same at prescribed counter by tendering prescribed amount and obtain a receipt. Besides devotional feature, equal emphasis is on Marketing feature. You can Sell God in India. Incredible India it is. May be our great seers like Swami Prabhupad or Acharya Rajneesh never even wildly imagined in their life times that they themselves are Saint Peter of Today's Vatican. But one thing whatsoever they sell, let it be books, audio, idols, souvenirs, every piece is beautifully crafted and produced. You will not regret for quality of products. There is a free kitchen besides other selling points for a variety of delicacies of India. The kitchen provides free food to whosoever comes to eat and trust me the food is simply delicious. Here in this complex, I fear one of the big shortcoming is parking. Lots and lots of tourists visit and parking space for vehicles is going to be a big issue, if not attended in time.

But if you happen to be in wrong attire they would provide dhoti to wrap around for Rs 20 which is non refundable and a refundable deposit of Rs 500 per piece. After the Darshan the exit takes you through the shop and canteen where you can buy food items prepared in the temple. The food is very good especially Mallpoa and should be tried.

ISKCON is very far from where I am staying, but it is the beauty of the temple which made me visit so many times. The temple is located on a hill and this is clearly visible from the entry gate itself. It is a very big temple. There is a barricade at the entrance of the temple where we must stand in a queue to enter the main gate. From there, we climb up some slope. After climbing, a counter will be there where we have to deposit our mobiles and slippers. Once we do, we move on. Here starts the queue. It is very long, we climb the steps and move on. There is greenery to the left hand side where we go in the queue. Inside the temple, firstly we shall have darshan of ""Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy"". The statutes are built very beautifully. Secondly, darshan of ""Sri Venkateshwara Swamy"" will be done. Again, the beauty of the deity is not to be missed. Finally, we reach the mandir of ""Lord Sri Krishna"" which is on the top. Awesome design, the crowd, the silence, charisma of Lord Sri Krishna will surely attract any tourist. Lord Krishna will appear in 3 screens, the middle one being Radha and Krishna. Whenever I come to ISKCON, I will surely sit and meditate here for at least 15 minutes. Once darshan is done, we move on to shopping arcade. Before that, there is a screen which shows how our soul moves in different bodies (child, adult, married man, old man, etc). There is huge shopping arcade as well as eatery. After shopping, we can find the place where we can have free meals. Also, there is a fountain where we can have a photo shoot or sit for some time and chit chat.

4176,4166,Trip Advisor,Jill W,01-02-2017,Worth a visit but commercial,"This is a large and beautiful temple. Unlike many temples we have visited in India, it is not ancient. It was completed, I believe, in the 1990s. It is very beautiful and quite large. It is the largest eat ISKCON temple in India and one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The views of the city from the climb to the temple were very nice. The visit is a self-guided tour with signs explaining various areas, beliefs, rituals, etc. of the Krishna belief. We went in a Sunday night. I think I remember it is open until 8:30pm on Sun. This was a good time to go, as there were not many locals there and basically no tourists. Also, it is cooler at night than during the day. The views of the city at night were also nice. Although entry is free, if one is a foreigner, they try to get you to pay (around $12US) for the ""short-cut"" line. This might be worth it when there are lots of people there, but I have been told even it can be very crowded. Once in either the long or short line, one must remove and leave their shoes in a bag for pick up afterward. This cost a few rupees. There are also other points along the way requiring, or urging additional fees. All told, including if one pays for the short-cut, maybe $25-$30US). On the way out, there are lots of little booths selling all manner of items. All in all, I'd say it's a definite ""should see"" if one is in Bangalore.

And 'beautiful to see, too bad the photos are strictly prohibited. Then begin an endless series of rooms on three floors, where they sell everything, including food. A junk of kitsch objects, both colorful and very young sellers, and cooks, and waiters and gardeners, and controllari, all senzaltro volunteers ... Ok, well we work voluntarily to political parties, but this visit I left a bitter taste in the mouth. Nothing to do with the spirituality of other temples we visited in three weeks in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. Too bad, it was the last day of our stay in India. Indian temple or supermarket?"

You are required to wear appropriate clothing which includes having neither your shoulders nor legs visible. I had not done my due diligence and I showed up in shorts. After selling me a ticket for 500 rupees (apparently I needed a special access ticket different from most people), they told me they would supply me with appropriate garments. Sure enough after the luggage and shoe check and just before the entrance they rented me a wrap around to cover my legs. 20 rupees + 500 rupee refundable deposit. I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors. The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet. From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these. Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge. I feel I offended them by not accepting but by that point I was anxious to leave. This temple really is an outstanding piece of architecture and the people seemed genuinely friendly and helpful.

I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors. The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet. From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these. Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge. I feel I offended them by not accepting but by that point I was anxious to leave. This temple really is an outstanding piece of architecture and the people seemed genuinely friendly and helpful. YMMV. Cognitive Dissonance"

ISKCON is a very popular destination accessible by Metro, Public transport, Auto,and Cabs, planing to take your car - well there is plenty of parking space. As you enter the huge and sprawling complex - Everything is organized very well. There is an orderly queue system - .after completing the mandatory security check, First you get a darshan of Lord Narasimha followed by a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara. Finally you climb to the top of the hill and enter the main temple to view Lord Krishna and Radha. The golden sanctum sanctorum, the marble flooring, the colorful paintings on the walls makes the darshan a great experience. After the darshan, there are many things to do in the temple complex - you can view a animation film on Krishna in the theater or you can visit the innumerable shops to buy the various products on sale - statues, photos, books and many other items. There are many food stalls and also a restaurant. You can even buy cakes (egg less of course). And before leaving you can favour the prasad, which is delicious. Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organized. A very important thing to note about ISKCON is its Akshay Patra scheme. ISKCON provides free food to lakhs of school going children as a part of the mid-day meal scheme. The maintenance of kitchen, the cleanliness, use of modern cooking technology and logistics is amazing. If you wish to be a donor or be part of any of their programs you can approach the temple authorities. If you are in Bangalore, make sure you visit ISKCON. You can easily spend a couple of hours in peace, getting the blessings of the Lord Krishna and also having a relaxing time. After the darshan of Lord Krishna and various other temple within the same complex, ISKCON also has vegetarian restaurant, the food served is Sathvik, a very good place for the vegetarians, seating arrangement is good (loved the sofas) and the service is satisfying, calm n peaceful ambience, with bhajans in the background, they have a very good variety in Buffet dinner starting from starters to deserts. The taste is good like I mentioned earlier service is at its best. They never haunt around you while eating but when you need them they will be in front of you very quickly. Overall, I definitely recommend this place and I have been a devotee of ISKCON for over 20 years now.

First thing first, they have ample parking so no need to worry - one has to somehow reach beating traffic in Bangalore. The way they have constructed four temples (one above the other) is a visual treat. The main temple has a lot of place to sit and enjoy the spiritual music. What follows after darshan is something many people may not like but I was fine. First, one has to necessarily go through all the spiritual / book stalls and then one will see a lot of food on sale. It is like a mall in my opinion. The only complain i have is the temple authorities should mention at the top itself the free food is served at the very end. What really happens is people get excited after looking at a lot of food options and they end up eating after which they have no appetite to enjoy the deliciously free meals.

I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push and pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance. For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well. Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god. So just a word of advice try avoid this place on overcrowded days and don't take aged people along with you who can't walk properly. The views are entirely personal not meant to be hurt anyone.

We were impressed by its efficiency... ticket, shoes, borrowing dhotis (heads up, it has dressing rules- no exposed knees or legs. We had to deposit 1000 rupees to borrow their dhotis), and admiring several temples as we climbed up. It concluded with many gift shops, concession stands, and book shops. Lots of people were there as is not uncommon wherever you go in India. In sum, the whole experience was different and it was in some way exhilarating.

One funny thing he forgot to mention though was that we had to walk barefoot from the parking lot, all the way to the temple. We didn't mind it though. A tip, leave your shoes in your car instead of leaving it in the repository as there are too many visitors and you risk losing your shoes or getting them mixed up, alternately you can stuff your shoes in your bag. Bring some wet ones to wipe off your dusty feet after the visit. The temple was majestic. Intricately designed all over. Going up the main staircase gave us a view of the lower parts of the temple, the roofs stunningly encased in gold! Inside the temple, we got to sit in the middle of a group of meditating and chanting visitors. Truly gave us a positive vibe.

On a Sunny day this could be a tad tiring. To start with, they have a very good arrangement of securing your slippers in. You can also opt for a locker where you can secure your valuables though i prefer not to carry any except a mobile phone (which is almost a body part these days) which also needs to be secured in a locker. You have to climb some steps to reach the top of the hill, where main abode, the hall for Krishna temple, Bhajans and meditation are all there. The first feeling is like a WOW!!! You can feel the bliss and the energy of all like minded people doing one thing - Praying and some trying to connect to inner self. Few things you will notice here are the cleanliness, greenery are outstanding. I think they truly believe cleanliness is next to godliness. Don't forget to collect the Prasadams on your way out. There are few shops on your way out, which sell a lot of literature about Lord Krishna and more. A few more shops for other religious and fancy purchases. A Very Godly Service they provide is through the Akshayapatra Foundation - I have been myself part of some Akshayapatra Service through CSR in my company and cant tell you how Fulfilling it is to see the free mid-day meal service being served to deserving kids across India.

Few things you will notice here are the cleanliness, greenery are outstanding. I think they truly believe cleanliness is next to godliness. Don't forget to collect the Prasadams on your way out. There are few shops on your way out, which sell a lot of literature about Lord Krishna and more. A few more shops for other religious and fancy purchases. A Very Godly Service they provide is through the Akshayapatra Foundation - I have been myself part of some Akshayapatra Service through CSR in my company and cant tell you how Fulfilling it is to see the free mid-day meal service being served to deserving kids across India. You can be a part of it once you enquirer there. Overall, Excellent and Truly blissful experience. Crowded outside, Bliss Inside"

The temple is not only well maintained but also well organised. Also you wont have any problems of any sort of request for offerings from the priests. They are well prepared if there is a rush. There is a big space allocated for keeping shoes and belongings. However if girls are going sleeveless then they will have to purchase/rent a shawl type stole, since the dress code is strict. Once you are inside the temple, taking of photographs is prohibited. Before entering the main temple of Krishna, you will be visiting the smaller temples of Shri Narasimha and Shri Venkatesh. Before entering the main temple, do look around from the top since the view is splendid (if you during a festival you might see fireworks which are awesome). The view is comparable to that of Birla Mandir in Hyderabad. Inside the temple there is a big hall with very nice paintings/carvings on the roof. The main temple has three chambers of deities. Everything is well managed and the Darshan is in a linear fashion. After the darshan in a line, you can sit in the specified place in front of the main chambers. Thereafter you will be going out the exit with various stalls of religious books and the volunteers will enlighten you on their programs if you are interested to go forward with it. After the exit downwards, you will get various shops of things to buy or eat. Thereafter before going to the fountain area you will get Prasadam. You can take a few pics in the fountain area where from the main temple is in view. After wards you can exit and at the exit there is a restaurant if you would like to eat. Bonus tip : One of the best malls of Bangalore is also nearby - Orion Mall - It has got everything in a mall (even Starbucks) and at the backside is a small artificial lake and am phi theater, sometimes musical fountain with lights is also there.

The entire temple complex is a series of vegetarian food shops on the ground floor...Ranging from over the counter snack shops to exorbitantly priced fine dining. Start climbing the stairs and you will be impressed with the semi modern architecture. Also the queues are efficiently organised and within 15 minutes you are in the main hall. The main hall is grand. A huge capola with frescos from the life of Krishna will keep you mesmerised till you reach the main shrine. For Rs. 150 per family you can break off from the regular line and get a family Darshan right in front of the deity. The way back winds through a series of outsourced counters where vendors try and sell you just about anything with branding of Krishna on the goods. That kills the euphoria and spirituality you felt a few moments back. TIP : The samosas stall on the way out has a good fare.

Seems as if it's real or everything is a passing dream not to be woken up. Pure bliss. One can buy the special darshan tickets for group of 4 or 6 person, which entitles speedy darshan including at Narasimha, Balaji and finally the Radha Krishna along with Nitai Gauranga and Krishna Balarama in main temple, by passing the queues. This pass also gives privilege to offer prayers (archana) and take prasads and books. However I would recommend going in normal queue, which gives the privilege of chanting ""Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times with other devotees as one climbs to the temple. Everyone is served a bowl of prasad at the exit and on Sundays it's lunch (satvik and tasty).

5369,5323,Trip Advisor,Divya S,05-07-2017,Serenity amidst a bustling city,"ISKCON at Bangalore is like a haven of peace and piety, amidst the hustle and bustle of a busy cosmopolitan city. The air itself calls out 'Krishna', even if the taped chants of 'Hare Krishna' weren't played at a loop. The first thing that strikes one about the temple, is the breathtaking majesty of its facade - this is one of the most beautifully designed Krishna temples ever! Situated high above a hill, so be prepared for climbing stairs, the Temple itself commands a panoramic view of the city, from the right side of the sanctum area. Remember the dress code and wear covered clothes - I was in a short sleeved dress, so wore long pajamas underneath to cover up. Also check the temple's timings before you go, it closes during the afternoon. There are toilet facilities (a bit better than primitive) that can be used if there is an absolute need to go. Shoes can be checked in at the shoe racks (hold your nose though, because that area smells of feet!), but to me, the best part is the luggage counter, because you can visit the temple and then go straight to the airport/railway station if you're so minded. There are a 108 steps that one is advised to stop at and chant the complete 'Hare Krishna' mantra for awakening inner consciousness and focusing on Krishna. Two smaller sanctums devoted to 'Prahalada' and 'Prabhupada', lead you on to the majestic main sanctum, which is done up in gold and will elicit an audible wow from most first timers. Onwards from the 'darshan', and there is a book counter, and the exit ways lead to other halls where one can purchase jaap maalas (Hindu rosaries), crystal trees, incense and essential oils, and a whole lot of other things besides. There is a lovely bakery too, and a proper Cafe, aptly names 'The Higher Consciousness'. Free prasadam that's basically made of sweetened tapioca pearls, and you can then take your leave, or stay for longer. It took me about an hour, at a rush, including the 108 chants, so perhaps one would be better advised to keep aside atleast a couple of hours for this beautiful sanctuary of inner consciousness.

Its has steps leading up to the main temple that might be a little tiring for the old folks. However, nice breeze blows all the time, especially during the evenings when the temple is well lighted. It's dedicated to Lord Krishna but has idols of other deities too. After having the main darshan and coming down the steps, there are small shops selling local savories and snacks, toys, religious books, pictures, idols and a whole variety of items. At the end of the steps, you get piping hot Prasadam in the form of Pongal/ khichdi/ sambhar rice. Outside the main temple but within its premises, there's a sattvic restaurant named Higher Taste. It has a buffet that's worth tasting once since all items on the menu are made without using onion and garlic, though prices are on a tad higher side. Would recommend visiting the temple at least once. Beautiful temple",4,POSITIVE,"We visited the Iskcon temple with our two kids. Its has steps leading up to the main temple that might be a little tiring for the old folks. However, nice breeze blows all the time, especially during the evenings when the temple is well lighted. It's dedicated to Lord Krishna but has idols of other deities too. After having the main darshan and coming down the steps, there are small shops selling local savories and snacks, toys, religious books, pictures, idols and a whole variety of items. At the end of the steps, you get piping hot Prasadam in the form of Pongal/ khichdi/ sambhar rice. Outside the main temple but within its premises, there's a sattvic restaurant named Higher Taste.
